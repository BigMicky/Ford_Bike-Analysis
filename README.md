## by Micheal Acquah



## Dataset

> This data set includes information about 14646 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
The data originally contain 16 charateristics for each individual rides
* duration_sec
* start_time
* end_time
* end_time
* start_station_id
* start_station_name
* start_station_latitude 
* start_station_longitude
* end_station_id
* end_station_name
* end_station_latitude
* end_station_longitude
* bike_id, 
* user_type
* member_birth_year
* member_gender
* bike_share_for_all_trip 



## Summary of Findings

> * The two days with most rides were Thursdays followed by Tuesday though it seems some people who rode on Tuesdays traveled futher distance than those on Thursdays.
> * The analysis revealed that a large proportion of the riders were under the age of 40, which is expected as individuals in this age group are typically healthier and more physically active.
> * Regardless of their gender or user type, most riders covered similar distances and rode for similar durations, which is an interesting finding.
> * Given that bikes are not typically used for long distance travel, it is not surprising that the majority of rides were less than 2 km and lasted less than 20 minutes. However, it was surprising to see that those who traveled for the longest durations did not cover the greatest distances.
> * The majority of riders were male, and most users were subscribers, which is not unexpected.
> * The fact that most rides occurred during rush hour (8am-9am and 5pm-6pm) is also unsurprising.
> * Gender and user type did not appear to have a significant impact on distance traveled or trip duration.
> * It was observed that individuals over the age of 60 tended to travel for shorter periods of time and cover less distance, indicating that they may not be using the bikes for commuting or exercise purposes.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From investigations, most Distance Traveled and Trip Duration is slightly similar across each user type but it seems more customers travel for more than 40 minutes as compared to subscribers.
> Most Distance Traveled and Trip Duration is slighty similar for each for across each gender but it seems some males traveled most distance, followed by 'others' and then the females. It was also be noticed that males and females who travel for more than 10 km didn't travel for more than 40 mins
> Age-wise it seem over 60 didn't travel pass some minutes or distance. This shows that to some extent age can affects distance traveled and trip duratance.
